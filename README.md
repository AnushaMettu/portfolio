## Projects
### Late Delivery Prediction using AWS

- The project focuses on building a comprehensive analytics solution for sales prediction and last delivery prediction utilizing various AWS services - Amazon S3, AWS Glue, Amazon Athena, Amazon SageMaker, and Boto3 to create an end-to-end cloud-based architecture.
- This combination enables scalable and efficient data storage, exploration, transformation, and analysis within the AWS cloud environment, including predictions using ML algorithms.

### Movie Analytics for effective recommendation

- Movie analytics offers powerful personalized movie recommendations based on user behavior, preferences, and ratings.
- To tackle the vast content available in the streaming industry, we developed a robust recommendation system using a hybrid approach combining collaborative filtering with Apache Spark & ML frameworks. Our method utilizes ALS filtering, considering a user's recent search history, and employs a matrix factorization model to address sparseness and scalability concerns, resulting in reliable and accurate movie suggestions for an enhanced user experience.

### Prediction of disease from symptoms with different Machine Learning Models

- Our project utilizes machine learning algorithms, employing Python Pandas and Numpy, we meticulously read, cleanse, analyze, and visually represent to analyze patient data, predicting diseases based on symptoms from a CSV file. Multiple models are employed to accommodate symptom variations, offering a user-friendly interface for easy disease prediction with 90% accuracy and precautionary measures, especially for those without frequent access to diagnostic centers.
